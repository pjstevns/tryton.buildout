Example buildout for the Tryton ERP system.

For Debian based systems first install the pre-dependencies:

apt-get install python-dev make gcc libc6-dev mercurial \
	zlib1g-dev wget libpq-dev libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev \
	libreadline-dev

First, check and edit buildout.cfg. Add eggs for additional 
modules you wish to deploy. For development of modules, you 
need to reference them in the 'develop' option and add them 
to the eggs, i.e.:

develop = 
    src/trytond_project_mykind

eggs = 
    ...
    trytond_project_mykind

Next, run 'make' inside this directory. This will install
all Tryton components, and also download, build and install
PostgreSQL inside the sandbox.

After 'make' has completed, you can do 'bin/supervisord' to
start both Trytond and PostgreSQL inside the sandbox.
