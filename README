Example buildout for the Tryton ERP system.

For Debian based systems first install the pre-dependencies:

apt-get install python-dev make gcc libc6-dev mercurial \
	zlib1g-dev wget libpq-dev libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev \
	libreadline-dev python-virtualenv

Production:
===========

First, check and edit buildout.cfg. Add eggs for additional 
modules you wish to deploy, i.e:

[tryton]
...
modules = 
	...
	trytond_project_plan

Next, run 'make' inside this directory. This will install
all Tryton components, and also download, build and install
PostgreSQL inside the sandbox.

After 'make' has completed, you can do 'bin/supervisord' to
start both Trytond and PostgreSQL inside the sandbox.


Development:
============

For development of modules, you need to reference them in the 
'sources' option and add them to the modules, i.e.:

[sources] 
trytond.modules.project_mykind = hg http://hg.trytond.org/modules/project_mykind

[tryton]
modules = 
    ...
    trytond_project_mykind

See devel.cfg for an example
